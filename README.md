Tutorial on how to use GitHub
I started using GitHub via my cousing Joe because he is helping me with a program. I'm having a little trouble understanding how to use GitHub and how to make changes to a file appropriately so that we can esily work on it together. 
The toughest part for me is executing the commands from the cmd prompt. :)
